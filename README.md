# Weather API

The Weather API allows you to fetch weather forecast data based on location coordinates or country name. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather information. Authentication is required to access the API endpoints.

Authentication

To access the API endpoints, you need to include a valid JSON Web Token (JWT) in the Authorization header of your requests. The JWT should be included in the format Bearer <access_token>.


To obtain an access token, you need to authenticate with the API using the /api/login endpoint. This endpoint requires the following parameters:

username: The username of the user.
password: The password of the user.

Example Request:
```json
POST /api/login HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "your_username",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

Example Response:
```json

{
  "token": "<access_token>"
}
```

### Include the obtained access token in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to the weather API endpoints.

Error Responses
400 Bad Request: When the required query parameters (lat, lon, or country) are missing or invalid.
401 Unauthorized: When authentication credentials are missing or invalid.
404 Not Found: When the weather forecast data is not available for the provided coordinates or country.
500 Internal Server Error: When there is a failure in fetching the weather forecast.
